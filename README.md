## Gameplay and Mechanics

### Pet Interaction
- Players can manage pet stats, including health, hunger, happiness, and sleep, through commands like feeding, playing, and putting the pet to sleep.
- Each pet type has unique behaviors and stat decay rates (e.g., some pets require more frequent feeding).

### Pet States
- Pets may enter special states (e.g., angry, hungry, tired) based on their stats, impacting player actions.

### Save/Load Game State
- **Save Game**: Players can save their game state, preserving pet stats, inventory, and progress.
- **Load Game**: Players can resume a saved game from the main menu.

### Player Inventory
- **Inventory Management**: Displays items such as food and gifts, with each item affecting pet stats differently.
- **Item Usage**: Item count decreases when used, with new items obtainable through in-game progression.

### Pet Sprite and Animation
- Sprite-based visuals reflect the pet's emotions and state (e.g., happy, tired, hungry).
- Simple animations (e.g., blinking, expressions) create a lifelike experience.

### Pet Commands
Players can issue commands to interact with their pet:
- **Feed Pet**: Increases fullness.
- **Play with Pet**: Boosts happiness.
- **Send Pet to Sleep**: Recovers sleep points but restricts interaction temporarily.
- **Take Pet to Vet**: Restores health.
- **Give Gift**: Enhances happiness with specific items.

*Note*: Pets entering critical states (e.g., extreme hunger) will limit available player options.

### Optional Features
- **High Score System**: Tracks and displays top scores based on care performance and positive interaction streaks.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Allows two players to compare progress and scores in competitive gameplay.
